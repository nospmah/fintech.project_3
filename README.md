## Project Description

<br>

What happens when you take "proof of work" literally? What if we incentivize group fitness through block-chain technology?

This project aims to build a competitive architecture on the block-chain around physical activity, incentivizing participants to compete for glory on daily leaderboards while mining FIT tokens (fungible) for their effort.

A proof-of-concept dApp will be developed to expore and test this idea.

<br>

### Objectives
* Define proposal ERC specification including contract interface definitions
* Build and deploy ERC20 complient contracts to Ropsten test network
* Build and deploy proof-of-concept, web-based dApp that integrates with Solidity contracts
* Users will mine FIT tokens (fungible) and post scores to leaderboards
* Identify future concepts/ideas to expore further

### Out of Scope
* The focus of this project is not token economics
* Production ready web UI and UX concerns

## Future Vision

<br>

* Various competitive architectures and token models
    * BlockFitter @Home
        * Validate work using machine learning on IOT edge enabled device
    * BlockFitter Affiliate Gym
        * Validate work using certified affiliate judges
    * BlockFitter Games
* Purchase NFTs with FIT tokens
* Earn NFTs for personal records or top leaderboard scores
* Tokenomics:
    * Percentage of earned FIT tokens distributed to affiliate gym and/or Blockfitter association
    * Build in FIT token deflationary mechanism
* NFT auction platform
* FIT tokens traded on exchange?

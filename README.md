## Project Description

<br>

What happens when you combine CrossFit and the block-chain?

This project aims to build a competitive architecture on the block-chain around physical activity, incentivising participants to compete on leaderboards while mining tokens for their effort.

A proof-of-concept dApp will be developed to expore and test this idea.

<br>

### Objectives
* Define proposal ERC specification including contract interface definitions
* Build and deploy ERC20 complient contracts to Ropsten test network
* Build and deploy proof-of-concept, web-based dApp that integrates with Solidity contracts
* Users will mine FIT tokens and post scores to leaderboards
* Identify future concepts/ideas to expore further

### Out of Scope
* The focus of this project is not token economics
* Production ready web UI and UX concerns
